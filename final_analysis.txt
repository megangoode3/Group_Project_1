Final Analysis

Though our findings are largely inconclusive in many ways, we did garner one takeaway: 
Based on our findings and given the way we viewed the data, population growth in the US 
doesnâ€™t pose a negative impact from an economic standpoint. However, if we looked at the 
data differently it may show varying results. We could, for instance, compare data based 
on pure population density rather than on the broader state by state basis. Even in our 
analysis we found that it played a role in how results were reflected. Another approach 
that could affect the outcome would be to go farther and compare variables on a global 
scale. Population growth is likely impacting other countries in a far more significant 
way. The analysis by state approach we took is simultaneously broad and isolated. 

Other questions for future research

How does the US compare globally in population growth?
How are the same variables impacted by population density?
What is the environmental impact of population growth?
What areas are experiencing population decline and what are the ramifications?
